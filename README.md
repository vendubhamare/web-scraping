Task 1
 
Scraping LinkedIn for Jobs posted by Companies (Using Scrapy or Selenium)
 
Steps: -
        
1.	Watch about basic selenium here if needed.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwLrdjgsJjU&ab_channel=edureka%21
2.	Go to careerguide.com (or any other website of your choice where you can find job types). Scrape Job types from there. Subcategories are divided by Categories.For eg:(Education->Tutor, Design and Art->Architect)
URL: https://www.careerguide.com/career-options
 
2.	Then you have to go to LinkedIn and scrape the jobs from there for every subcategory you scraped from caeerguide which will be under a state(state means a location like Delhi, Punjab..)
(State -> category of job -> job)
You will have to scrape 3 things from the job:
•	Job position (e.g.: Analyst, Software Engineer)
•	Company name and link offering the Job
•	Location of the Job (City or remote)
